The patterns Strategy and Visitor manage two objectives. Putting in similar actions and letting them assume according to their needs is called a Strategy pattern. When an object has to be modified dynamically. In this assignment, it's used to calculate emissions fees. The other pattern “Visitor” is used when classes ate related and multiple functionalities need to be done. Classes in this case being, Car, Motorbike, and Van. It operates in a constant pattern and calculates inspection fees. When comparing all patterns, the Strategy pattern is manageable and easily accessible because it has a transparent runtime with any changes. This can be used in cases like this as this project will change its statistics over time. It changes with internal and external inputs from the users and developers.
