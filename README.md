# VisitorDesignPattern
Construction Lab 2

Activity 1:
For Activity 1, I have created alternative files for the indicated with “Alt” in front of the file name. The Alt files have modified code for the original files but have the same utility. 

Activity 2: 
For Activity 2, the implementation of Singleton is required for the code to run. Hence, I created Act2Main and Act2VehicleService to calculate the total cost. I did the initialization to build “vi”. 

Activity 3: 
Expanded VehicleInspection to calculate emission fees depending on multiple and suitable situations. This part contains ‘es’ to select the emission fees. 

Patterns: 
Visitor, Strategy, and Singleton are the 3 patterns used. 

Visitor for inspection fees, strategy for emissions fee and Singleton to make sure that there is only one “Alt3VehicleService”.
